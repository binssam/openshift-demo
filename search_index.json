AD","keywords":"","body":"Authentication Providers with AD\n\n\nAuthentication Providers with AD\nPrerequisites\nOpenShift RBAC with AD\nBackground: LDAP Structure\nExamine the OAuth configuration\nSyncing LDAP Groups to OpenShift Groups\nChange Group Policy\nExamine cluster-admin policy\nExamine cluster-reader policy\nCreate Projects for Collaboration\nMap Groups to Projects\nExamine Group Access\nPrometheus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nMicrosoft AD (with LDAP protocol)\nUsers and Groups\nAssigned Roles\n\nOpenShift RBAC with AD\nConfiguring External Authentication Providers\nOpenShift supports a number of different authentication providers, and you can\nfind the complete list in the understanding identity provider configuration. One of the most commonly used authentication\nproviders is LDAP, whether provided by Microsoft Active Directory or by other\nsources.\nOpenShift can perform user authentication against an LDAP server, and can also\nconfigure group membership and certain RBAC attributes based on LDAP group\nmembership.\nBackground: LDAP Structure\nIn this environment we are providing LDAP with the following user groups:\n\nocp-user: Users with OpenShift access\nAny users who should be able to log-in to OpenShift must be members of this\ngroup\nAll of the below mentioned users are in this group\n\n\nocp-normal-dev: Normal OpenShift users\nRegular users of OpenShift without special permissions\nContains: normaluser1, teamuser1, teamuser2\n\n\nocp-fancy-dev: Fancy OpenShift users\nUsers of OpenShift that are granted some special privileges\nContains: fancyuser1, fancyuser2\n\n\nocp-teamed-app: Teamed app users\nA group of users that will have access to the same OpenShift Project\nContains: teamuser1, teamuser2\n\n\n\nExamine the OAuth configuration\nSince this is a pure, vanilla OpenShift 4 installation, it has the default OAuth resource. You can examine that OAuth configuration with the following:\noc get oauth cluster -o yaml\n\nYou will see something like:\napiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1\nkind: OAuth\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    release.openshift.io/create-only: \"true\"\n  creationTimestamp: \"2020-03-17T18:12:52Z\"\n  generation: 1\n  name: cluster\n  resourceVersion: \"1563\"\n  selfLink: /apis/config.openshift.io/v1/oauths/cluster\n  uid: ebb0582d-b0e4-4c40-a33f-12459593f8e2\nspec: {}\n\nThere are a few things to note here. Firstly, there's basically nothing here!\nHow does the kubeadmin user work, then? The OpenShift OAuth system knows to\nlook for a kubeadmin Secret in the kube-system Namespace. You can\nexamine it with the following:\noc get secret -n kube-system kubeadmin -o yaml\n\nYou will see something like:\napiVersion: v1\ndata:\n  kubeadmin: JDJhJDEwJDdQNHZtbXMxdmpDa3FsNlJMLjJBcC5BSWdBazB6d09IWUdXZEdrRXBERGRwWXNmVVcxanpX\nkind: Secret\nmetadata:\n  creationTimestamp: \"2019-04-29T17:30:51Z\"\n  name: kubeadmin\n  namespace: kube-system\n  resourceVersion: \"2065\"\n  selfLink: /api/v1/namespaces/kube-system/secrets/kubeadmin\n  uid: 892945dc-6aa4-11e9-9959-02774c6d6b2e\ntype: Opaque\n\nThat Secret contains the encoded hash of the kubeadmin password. This\naccount will continue to work even after we configure a new OAuth. If you\nwant to disable it, you would need to delete the secret.\nIn a real-world environment, you will likely want to integrate with your\nexisting identity management solution. For this lab we are configuring LDAP\nas our identityProvider. Here's an example of the OAuth configuration. Look\nfor the element in identityProviders with type: LDAP like the following:\napiVersion: config.openshift.io/v1\nkind: OAuth\nmetadata:\n  name: cluster\nspec:\n  identityProviders:\n  - name: ldap\n    challenge: false\n    login: true\n    mappingMethod: claim\n    type: LDAP\n    ldap:\n      attributes:\n        id:\n        - distinguishedName\n        email:\n        - userPrincipalName\n        name:\n        - givenName\n        preferredUsername:\n        - sAMAccountName\n      bindDN: \"cn=ldapuser,cn=Users,dc=dcloud,dc=demo,dc=com\"\n      bindPassword:\n        name: ldapuser-secret\n      insecure: true\n      url: \"ldap://ad1.dcloud.demo.com:389/cn=Users,dc=dcloud,dc=demo,dc=com?sAMAccountName?sub?(memberOf=cn=ocp-user,cn=Users,dc=dcloud,dc=demo,dc=com)\"\n  tokenConfig:\n    accessTokenMaxAgeSeconds: 86400\n\nSome notable fields under identityProviders::\n\nname: The unique ID of the identity provider.

There is a section in the documentation on how to\nsync groups with LDAP. Syncing groups involves running a program called groupsync\nwhen logged into OpenShift as a user with cluster-admin privileges, and using\na configuration file that tells OpenShift what to do with the users it finds in\nthe various groups.\nWe have provided a groupsync configuration file for you:\nView configuration file\nkind: LDAPSyncConfig\napiVersion: v1\nurl: ldap://ad1.dcloud.demo.com:389\ninsecure: true\nbindDN: cn=ldapuser,cn=Users,dc=dcloud,dc=demo,dc=com\nbindPassword: b1ndP^ssword\nrfc2307:\n  groupsQuery:\n    baseDN: cn=Users,dc=dcloud,dc=demo,dc=com\n    derefAliases: never\n    filter: (cn=ocp-*)\n    scope: sub\n    pageSize: 0\n  groupUIDAttribute: distinguishedName\n  groupNameAttributes:\n  - cn\n  groupMembershipAttributes:\n  - member\n  usersQuery:\n    baseDN: cn=Users,dc=dcloud,dc=demo,dc=com\n    derefAliases: never\n    filter: (objectclass=user)\n    scope: sub\n    pageSize: 0\n  userUIDAttribute: distinguishedName\n  userNameAttributes:\n  - sAMAccountName\n\nWithout going into too much detail (you can look at the documentation), the\ngroupsync config file does the following:\n\nsearches LDAP using the specified bind user and password\nqueries for any LDAP groups whocp name begins with ocp-\ncreates OpenShift groups with a name from the cn of the LDAP group\nfinds the members of the LDAP group and then puts them into the created\nOpenShift group\nuses the dn and uid as the UID and name attributes, respectively, in\nOpenShift\n\nExecute the groupsync:\ncat  groupsync.yaml\nkind: LDAPSyncConfig\napiVersion: v1\nurl: ldap://ad1.dcloud.demo.com:389\ninsecure: true\nbindDN: cn=ldapuser,cn=Users,dc=dcloud,dc=demo,dc=com\nbindPassword: b1ndP^ssword\nrfc2307:\n  groupsQuery:\n    baseDN: cn=Users,dc=dcloud,dc=demo,dc=com\n    derefAliases: never\n    filter: (cn=ocp-*)\n    scope: sub\n    pageSize: 0\n  groupUIDAttribute: distinguishedName\n  groupNameAttributes:\n  - cn\n  groupMembershipAttributes:\n  - member\n  usersQuery:\n    baseDN: cn=Users,dc=dcloud,dc=demo,dc=com\n    derefAliases: never\n    filter: (objectclass=user)\n    scope: sub\n    pageSize: 0\n  userUIDAttribute: distinguishedName\n  userNameAttributes:\n  - sAMAccountName\nEOF\noc adm groups sync --sync-config=./groupsync.yaml --confirm\n\nYou will see output like the following:\ngroup/ocp-fancy-dev\ngroup/ocp-user\ngroup/ocp-normal-dev\ngroup/ocp-teamed-app\n\nWhat you are seeing is the Group objects that have been created by the\ngroupsync command. If you are curious about the --confirm flag, check the\noutput of the help with oc adm groups sync -h.\nIf you want to see the Groups that were created, execute the following:\noc get groups\n\nYou will see output like the following:\nNAME             USERS\nocp-admin        ldapuser\nocp-fancy-dev    fancyuser1, fancyuser2\nocp-normal-dev   normaluser1, teamuser1, teamuser2\nocp-teamed-app   teamuser1, teamuser2\nocp-user         fancyuser1, fancyuser2, normaluser1, teamuser1, teamuser2\n\nTake a look at a specific group in YAML:\noc get group ocp-fancy-dev -o yaml\n\nThe YAML looks like:\napiVersion: user.openshift.io/v1\nkind: Group\nmetadata:\n  annotations:\n    openshift.io/ldap.sync-time: 2020-03-11T10:57:03-0400\n    openshift.io/ldap.uid: cn=ocp-fancy-dev,ou=Users,o=5e615ba46b812e7da02e93b5,dc=jumpcloud,dc=com\n    openshift.io/ldap.url: ldap.jumpcloud.com:636\n  creationTimestamp: \"2020-03-11T14:57:03Z\"\n  labels:\n    openshift.io/ldap.host: ldap.jumpcloud.com\n  name: ocp-fancy-dev\n  resourceVersion: \"48481\"\n  selfLink: /apis/user.openshift.io/v1/groups/ocp-fancy-dev\n  uid: 630a9d2b-b577-46bd-8294-6b26e7f9a6e1\nusers:\n- fancyuser1\n- fancyuser2\n\nOpenShift has automatically associated some LDAP metadata with the Group, and\nhas listed the users who are in the group.\nWhat happens if you list the Users?\noc get user\n\nYou will get:\nNo resources found.\n\nWhy would there be no Users found? They are clearly listed in the Group\ndefinition.\nUsers are not actually created until the first time they try to log in. What\nyou are seeing in the Group definition is simply a placeholder telling\nOpenShift that, if it encounters a User with that specific ID, that it should\nbe associated with the Group.\nChange Group Policy\nWe will grant a cluster role cluster-admin to ldap group ocp-admin\nChange the policy for the ocp-admin Group:\noc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group cluster-admin ocp-admin\n\nIn your environment, there is a special group of super developers called\nocp-fancy-dev who should have special cluster-reader privileges. This is a role\nthat allows a user to view administrative-level information about the cluster.\nFor example, they can see the list of all Projects in the cluster.\nChange the policy for the ocp-fancy-dev Group:\noc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-group cluster-reader ocp-fancy-dev\n\nNote: If you are interested in the different roles that come with OpenShift, you can\nlearn more about them in the\nrole-based access control (RBAC) documentation.\nExamine cluster-admin policy\nlogin as a ldapuser\noc login -u ldapuser -p b1ndP^ssword\n\nThen, try to list Projects:\noc get projects\n\nYou will see a full list of projects.\nExamine cluster-reader policy\nGo ahead and login as a regular user:\noc login -u normaluser1 -p openshift\n\nThen, try to list Projects:\noc get projects\n\nYou will see:\nNo resources found.\n\nNow, login as a member of ocp-fancy-dev:\noc login -u fancyuser1 -p openshift\n\nAnd then perform the same oc get projects and you will now see the list of all\nof the projects in the cluster:\nNAME                                                    DISPLAY NAME                        STATUS\n    app-management\n  * default\n    kube-public\n    kube-system\n    labguide\n    openshift\n    openshift-apiserver\n...\n\nYou should now be starting to understand how RBAC in OpenShift Container\nPlatform can work.\nCreate Projects for Collaboration\nMake sure you login as the cluster administrator:\noc login -u ldapuser\n\nThen, create several Projects for people to collaborate:\noc adm new-project app-dev --display-name=\"Application Development\"\noc adm new-project app-test --display-name=\"Application Testing\"\noc adm new-project app-prod --display-name=\"Application Production\"\n\nYou have now created several Projects that represent a typical Software\nDevelopment Lifecycle setup. Next, you will configure Groups to grant\ncollaborative access to these projects.\nNote: Creating projects with oc adm new-project does not use the project request\nprocess or the project request template. These projects will not have quotas or\nlimitranges applied by default. A cluster administrator can \"impersonate\" other\nusers, so there are several options if you wanted these projects to get\nquotas/limit ranges:\n. use --as to specify impersonating a regular user with oc new-project\n. use oc process and provide values for the project request template, piping\n  into create (eg: oc process ... | oc create -f -). This will create all of\n  the objects in the project request template, which would include the quota and\n  limit range.\n. manually create/define the quota and limit ranges after creating the projects.\nFor these exercises it is not important to have quotas or limit ranges on these\nprojects.\nMap Groups to Projects\nAs you saw earlier, there are several roles within OpenShift that are\npreconfigured. When it comes to Projects, you similarly can grant view, edit,\nor administrative access. Let's give our ocp-teamed-app users access to edit the\ndevelopment and testing projects:\noc adm policy add-role-to-group edit ocp-teamed-app -n app-dev\noc adm policy add-role-to-group edit ocp-teamed-app -n app-test\n\nAnd then give them access to view production:\noc adm policy add-role-to-group view ocp-teamed-app -n app-prod\n\nNow, give the ocp-fancy-dev group edit access to the production project:\noc adm policy add-role-to-group edit ocp-fancy-dev -n app-prod\n\nExamine Group Access\nLog in as normaluser1 and see what Projects you can see:\noc login -u normaluser1 -p openshift\noc get projects\n\nYou should get:\nNo resources found.\n\nThen, try teamuser1 from the ocp-teamed-app group:\noc login -u teamuser1 -p openshift\noc get projects\n\nYou should get:\nNAME       DISPLAY NAME              STATUS\napp-dev    Application Development   Active\napp-prod   Application Production    Active\napp-test   Application Testing       Active\n\nYou did not grant the team users edit access to the production project. Go ahead\nand try to create something in the production project as teamuser1:\noc project app-prod\noc new-app docker.io/siamaksade/mapit\n\nYou will see that it will not work:\nerror: can't lookup images: imagestreamimports.image.openshift.io is forbidden: User \"teamuser1\" cannot create resource \"imagestreamimports\" in API group \"image.openshift.io\" in the namespace \"app-prod\"\nerror:  local file access failed with: stat docker.io/siamaksade/mapit: no such file or directory\nerror: unable to locate any images in image streams, templates loaded in accessible projects, template files, local docker images with name \"docker.io/siamaksade/mapit\"\n\nArgument 'docker.io/siamaksade/mapit' was classified as an image, image~source, or loaded template reference.\n\nThe 'oc new-app' command will match arguments to the following types:\n\n  1. Images tagged into image streams in the current project or the 'openshift' project\n     - if you don't specify a tag, we'll add ':latest'\n  2. Images in the Docker Hub, on remote registries, or on the local Docker engine\n  3. Templates in the current project or the 'openshift' project\n  4. Git repository URLs or local paths that point to Git repositories\n\n--allow-missing-images can be used to point to an image that does not exist yet.\n\nSee 'oc new-app -h' for examples.\n\nThis failure is exactly what we wanted to see.\nPrometheus\nNow that you have a user with cluster-reader privileges (one that can see\nmany administrative aspects of the cluster), we can revisit Prometheus and\nattempt to log-in to it.\nLogin as a the user with cluster-reader privileges:\noc login -u fancyuser1 -p openshift\n\nFind the prometheus Route with the following command:\noc get route prometheus-k8s -n openshift-monitoring\n\nYou will see something like the following:\nNAME             HOST/PORT                                                                      PATH   SERVICES         PORT   TERMINATION          WILDCARD\nprometheus-k8s   prometheus-k8s-openshift-monitoring.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}          prometheus-k8s   web    reencrypt/Redirect   None\n\nWarning: Before continuing, make sure to go to the OpenShift web console and log out\nby using the dropdown menu at the upper right where it says kube:admin.\nOtherwise Prometheus will try to use your kubeadmin user to pass through\nauthentication. While it will work, it doesn't demonstrate the\ncluster-reader role.\nThe installer configured a Route for Prometheus by default. Go ahead and\ncontrol+click the Prometheus link to open it in your browser. You'll be\ngreeted with a login screen. Click the Log in with OpenShift button, then\nselect the ldap auth mechanism, and use the fancyuser1 user that you gave\ncluster-reader privileges to earlier. More specifically, the\nocp-fancy-dev group has cluster-reader permissions, and fancyuser1 is a\nmember. Remember that the password for all of these users is openshift. You\nwill probably get a certificate error because of the self-signed certificate.\nMake sure to accept it.\nAfter logging in, the first time you will be presented with an auth proxy\npermissions acknowledgement.\nThere is actually an OAuth proxy that sits in the flow between you and the\nPrometheus container. This proxy is used to validate your AuthenticatioN\n(AuthN) as well as authorize (AuthZ) what is allowed to happen. Here you are\nexplicitly authorizing the permissions from your fancyuser1 account to be\nused as part of accessing Prometheus. Hit Allow selected permissions.\nAt this point you are viewing Prometheus. There are no alerts configured. If\nyou look at Status and then Targets you can see some interesting\ninformation about the current state of the cluster.\n"},"infrastructure-infra-nodes.html":{"url":"infrastructure-infra-nodes.html","title":"OpenShift MachineSet and Infrastructure Nodes","keywords":"","body":"OpenShift Infrastructure Nodes\n\n\nOpenShift Infrastructure Nodes\nPrerequisites\nOpenShift Infrastructure Nodes\nOpenShift MachineSet\nDefining a Custom MachineSet\nLogging\n\n\nMachine Config\nMachineConfig overview\nChecking Machine Config Pool status\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nOpenShift 4.6 on VMware 6.7 U3+ or 7.0\nVMware Cloud Native Storage to support CNS CSI\nResources enough to provision 3 infra nodes e.g. 4vCPU, 16GB RAM per node\n\nOpenShift Infrastructure Nodes\nThe OpenShift subscription model allows customers to run various core infrastructure components at no additional charge.

Then, we can configure the various infrastructure components to run specifically on nodes with those labels.\nTo accomplish this, you will create additional MachineSets.\nIn order to understand how MachineSets work, run the following.\nThis will allow you to follow along with some of the following discussion.\noc get machineset -n openshift-machine-api -o yaml $(oc get machineset -n openshift-machine-api | grep worker | cut -d' ' -f 1)\nSample Output\napiVersion: machine.openshift.io/v1beta1\nkind: MachineSet\nmetadata:\n  creationTimestamp: \"2020-12-28T05:02:31Z\"\n  generation: 3\n  labels:\n    machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-cluster: ocp01-7k4c4\n  name: ocp01-7k4c4-worker\n  namespace: openshift-machine-api\n  resourceVersion: \"799241\"\n  selfLink: /apis/machine.openshift.io/v1beta1/namespaces/openshift-machine-api/machinesets/ocp01-7k4c4-worker\n  uid: 52ad683d-99b6-423b-b045-4279f241640e\nspec:\n  replicas: 1\n  selector:\n    matchLabels:\n      machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-cluster: ocp01-7k4c4\n      machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset: ocp01-7k4c4-worker\n  template:\n    metadata:\n      labels:\n        machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-cluster: ocp01-7k4c4\n        machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-role: worker\n        machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machine-type: worker\n        machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset: ocp01-7k4c4-worker\n    spec:\n      metadata: {}\n      providerSpec:\n        value:\n          apiVersion: vsphereprovider.openshift.io/v1beta1\n          credentialsSecret:\n            name: vsphere-cloud-credentials\n          diskGiB: 120\n          kind: VSphereMachineProviderSpec\n          memoryMiB: 8192\n          metadata:\n            creationTimestamp: null\n          network:\n            devices:\n            - networkName: VM Network\n          numCPUs: 2\n          numCoresPerSocket: 2\n          snapshot: \"\"\n          template: ocp01-7k4c4-rhcos\n          userDataSecret:\n            name: worker-user-data\n          workspace:\n            datacenter: dCloud-DC\n            datastore: NFS_Datastore\n            folder: /dCloud-DC/vm/ocp01-7k4c4\n            resourcePool: /dCloud-DC/host/dCloud-Cluster/Resources\n            server: vc1.dcloud.cisco.com\nstatus:\n  availableReplicas: 1\n  fullyLabeledReplicas: 1\n  observedGeneration: 3\n  readyReplicas: 1\n  replicas: 1\nImportant information in MachineSet\n\nMetadata\nThe metadata on the MachineSet itself includes information like the name of the MachineSet and various labels.\nSelector\nThe MachineSet defines how to create Machines, and the Selector tells the operator which machines are associated with the set\nTemplate Metadata\nThe template is the part of the MachineSet that templates out the Machine. The template itself can have metadata associated, and we need to make sure that things match here when we make changes:\nTemplate Spec\nThe template needs to specify how the Machine/Node should be created. You will notice that the spec and, more specifically, the providerSpec contains all of the important AWS data to help get the Machine created correctly and bootstrapped.\nIn our case, we want to ensure that the resulting node inherits one or more specific labels. As youâ€™ve seen in the examples above, labels go in metadata sections:\n\n\nDefining a Custom MachineSet\nNow that youâ€™ve analyzed an existing MachineSet itâ€™s time to go over the rules for creating one, at least for a simple change like weâ€™re making:\n\nDonâ€™t change anything in the providerSpec\nDonâ€™t change any instances of machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-cluster: \nGive your MachineSet a unique name\nMake sure any instances of machine.openshift.io/cluster-api-machineset match the name\nAdd labels you want on the nodes to .spec.template.spec.metadata.labels\nEven though youâ€™re changing MachineSet name references, be sure not to change the subnet.\n\nThis sounds complicated, but we have a template that will do the hard work for you:\nexport CLUSTERID=$(oc get machineset -n openshift-machine-api | grep worker | cut -d' ' -f 1 | sed 's/-worker//g')\n\ncat oc get machineset -n openshift-machine-api\nYou should see the new infra set listed with a name similar to the following:\nocp01-7k4c4-infra    1         1                             13s\nWe donâ€™t yet have any ready or available machines in the set because the instances are still coming up and bootstrapping. You can check oc get machine -n openshift-machine-api to see when the instance finally starts running. Then, you can use oc get node to see when the actual node is joined and ready.\nNote:\nIt can take several minutes for a Machine to be prepared and added as a Node.\noc get nodes\nNAME                       STATUS   ROLES          AGE   VERSION\nocp01-7k4c4-infra-tz8w4    Ready    infra,worker   18m   v1.19.0+7070803\nocp01-7k4c4-master-0       Ready    master         2d    v1.19.0+7070803\nocp01-7k4c4-master-1       Ready    master         2d    v1.19.0+7070803\nocp01-7k4c4-master-2       Ready    master         2d    v1.19.0+7070803\nocp01-7k4c4-worker-wbq9b   Ready    worker         56m   v1.19.0+7070803\nocp01-7k4c4-worker-zw9w8   Ready    worker         2d    v1.19.0+7070803\nIf youâ€™re having trouble figuring out which node is the new one, take a look at the AGE column.

Also, in the ROLES column you will notice that the new node has both a worker and an infra role.\nFor the HA, we will need 3 infra nodes.\nexport $INFRAMS=$(oc get machineset -n openshift-machine-api | grep infra | cut -d' ' -f 1)\noc scale machineset $INFRAMS -n openshift-machine-api --replicas=3\nBinding infrastructure node workloads using taints and tolerations\nIf you have an infra node that has the infra and worker roles assigned, you must configure the node so that user workloads are not assigned to it.\nUse the following command to add a taint to the infra node to prevent scheduling user workloads on it:\nfor node in $(oc get nodes | grep infra | cut -d' ' -f 1 ); do\n    oc adm taint nodes $node node-role.kubernetes.io/infra:NoSchedule\ndone\nCheck the Labels\nWe can ask what its labels are by using command:\noc get nodes --show-labels -l node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=\nOutput\nNAME                      STATUS   ROLES          AGE   VERSION           LABELS\nocp01-7k4c4-infra-tz8w4   Ready    infra,worker   10m   v1.19.0+7070803   beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,kubernetes.io/hostname=ocp01-7k4c4-infra-tz8w4,kubernetes.io/os=linux,node-role.kubernetes.io/infra=,node-role.kubernetes.io/worker=,node.openshift.io/os_id=rhcos\nMoving Infrastructure Components\nNow that you have infra nodes, itâ€™s time to move various infrastructure components onto them.\nRouter\nThe OpenShift router is managed by an Operator called openshift-ingress-operator. Its Pod lives in the openshift-ingress-operator project:\nRegistry\nThe registry uses a similar CRD mechanism to configure how the operator deploys the actual registry pods. That CRD is configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io. You will edit the cluster CR object in order to add the nodeSelector\noc patch configs.imageregistry.operator.openshift.io/cluster -p '{\"spec\":{\"nodeSelector\":{\"node-role.kubernetes.io/infra\": \"\"},\"tolerations\": [{\"effect\": \"NoSchedule\",\"key\": \"node-role.kubernetes.io/infra\",\"operator\": \"Exists\"}]}}' --type=merge\nMonitoring\nThe Cluster Monitoring operator is responsible for deploying and managing the state of the Prometheus+Grafana+AlertManager cluster monitoring stack. It is installed by default during the initial cluster installation.

There is a dedicated lab exercise that goes through the configuration and deployment of logging.\nMachine Config\nThere are times when you need to make changes to the operating systems running on OpenShift Container Platform nodes. This can include changing settings for network time service, adding kernel arguments, or configuring journaling in a specific way.\nMachineConfig overview\nThe Machine Config Operator (MCO) manages updates to systemd, CRI-O and Kubelet, the kernel, Network Manager and other system features. It also offers a MachineConfig CRD that can write configuration files onto the host. Understanding what MCO does and how it interacts with other components is critical to making advanced, system-level changes to an OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Here are some things you should know about MCO, MachineConfigs, and how they are used:\n\nA MachineConfig can make a specific change to a file or service on the operating system of each system representing a pool of OpenShift Container Platform nodes.\nMCO is only supported for writing to files in /etc and /var directories, although there are symbolic links to some directories that can be writeable by being symbolically linked to one of those areas. The /opt directory is an example.\nIgnition is the configuration format used in MachineConfigs. See the Ignition Configuration Specification v3.1.0 for details.\n\nChecking Machine Config Pool status\nTo see the status of the Machine Config Operator, its sub-components, and the resources it manages, use the following oc commands:\nProcedure\nTo see the number of MCO-managed nodes available on your cluster for each pool, type:\noc get machineconfigpool\nresult\nNAME      CONFIG                  UPDATED  UPDATING   DEGRADED  MACHINECOUNT  READYMACHINECOUNT  UPDATEDMACHINECOUNT DEGRADEDMACHINECOUNT  AGE\nmaster    rendered-master-ddâ€¦     True     False      False     3             3                  3                                0                     4h42m\nworker    rendered-worker-fdeâ€¦    True     False      False     3             3                  3                                0                     4h42m\nIn the previous output, there are three master and three worker nodes. All machines are updated and none are currently updating. Because all nodes are Updated and Ready and none are Degraded, you can ell that there are no issues.\nTo see each existing machineconfig, type:\noc get machineconfigs\nresult\nNAME                             GENERATEDBYCONTROLLER          IGNITIONVERSION  AGE\n00-master                        2c9371fbb673b97a6fe8b1c52...   3.1.0            5h18m\n00-worker                        2c9371fbb673b97a6fe8b1c52...   3.1.0            5h18m\n01-master-container-runtime      2c9371fbb673b97a6fe8b1c52...   3.1.0            5h18m\n01-master-kubelet                2c9371fbb673b97a6fe8b1c52â€¦     3.1.0            5h18m\n...\nrendered-master-dde...           2c9371fbb673b97a6fe8b1c52...   3.1.0            5h18m\nrendered-worker-fde...           2c9371fbb673b97a6fe8b1c52...   3.1.0            5h18m\nNote that the machineconfigs listed as rendered are not meant to be changed or deleted. Expect them to be hidden at some point in the future.\nCheck the status of worker (or change to master) to see the status of that pool of nodes:\n``\noc describe mcp worker\n...\n  Degraded Machine Count:     0\n  Machine Count:              3\n  Observed Generation:        2\n  Ready Machine Count:        3\n  Unavailable Machine Count:  0\n  Updated Machine Count:      3\nEvents:                       \nYou can view the contents of a particular machineconfig (in this case, 01-master-kubelet). The trimmed output from the following oc describe command shows that this machineconfig contains both configuration files (cloud.conf and kubelet.conf) and a systemd service (Kubernetes Kubelet):\noc describe machineconfigs 01-master-kubelet\nresult\nName:         01-master-kubelet\n...\nSpec:\n  Config:\n    Ignition:\n      Version:  3.1.0\n    Storage:\n      Files:\n        Contents:\n          Source:   data:,\n        Mode:       420\n        Overwrite:  true\n        Path:       /etc/kubernetes/cloud.conf\n        Contents:\n          Source:   data:,kind%3A%20KubeletConfiguration%0AapiVersion%3A%20kubelet.config.k8s.io%2Fv1beta1%0Aauthentication%3A%0A%20%20x509%3A%0A%20%20%20%20clientCAFile%3A%20%2Fetc%2Fkubernetes%2Fkubelet-ca.crt%0A%20%20anonymous...\n        Mode:       420\n        Overwrite:  true\n        Path:       /etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf\n    Systemd:\n      Units:\n        Contents:  [Unit]\nDescription=Kubernetes Kubelet\nWants=rpc-statd.service network-online.target crio.service\nAfter=network-online.target crio.service\n\nExecStart=/usr/bin/hyperkube \\\n    kubelet \\\n      --config=/etc/kubernetes/kubelet.conf \\ ...\\\nUsing MachineConfigs to configure nodes\nTasks in this section let you create MachineConfig objects to modify files, systemd unit files, and other operating system features running on OpenShift Container Platform nodes. For more ideas on working with MachineConfigs, see content related to changing MTU network settings, adding or updating SSH authorized keys, , replacing DNS nameservers, verifying image signatures, enabling SCTP, and configuring iSCSI initiatornames for OpenShift Container Platform.\nMachineConfigs\nOpenShift Container Platform version 4.6 supports Ignition specification version 3.1. All new MachineConfigs you create going forward should be based on Ignition specification version 3.1. If you are upgrading your OpenShift Container Platform cluster, any existing Ignition specification version 2.x MachineConfigs will be translated automatically to specification version 3.1.\nConfiguring chrony time service\nYou can set the time server and related settings used by the chrony time service (chronyd) by modifying the contents of the chrony.conf file and passing those contents to your nodes as a machine config.\nProcedure\n\nCreate the contents of the chrony.conf file and encode it as base64. Specify any valid, reachable time source. For example:\ncat  chrony.conf\npool 198.18.128.1 iburst\ndriftfile /var/lib/chrony/drift\nrtcsync\nmakestep 1.0 3\nlogdir /var/log/chrony\nEOF\n\nCreate the MachineConfig object file, replacing the base64 string with the one you just created yourself. This example adds the file to master nodes. You can change it to worker or make an additional MachineConfig object for the worker role:\ncat  ./99_masters-chrony-configuration.yaml\napiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1\nkind: MachineConfig\nmetadata:\n  creationTimestamp: null\n  labels:\n    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: master\n  name: 99-master-etc-chrony-conf\nspec:\n  config:\n    ignition:\n      config: {}\n      security:\n        tls: {}\n      timeouts: {}\n      version: 3.1.0\n    networkd: {}\n    passwd: {}\n    storage:\n      files:\n      - contents:\n          source: data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,$(cat chrony.conf | base64 -w 0)\n        group:\n          name: root\n        mode: 420\n        overwrite: true\n        path: /etc/chrony.conf\n        user:\n          name: root\n  osImageURL: \"\"\nEOF\n\ncat  ./99_workers-chrony-configuration.yaml\napiVersion: machineconfiguration.openshift.io/v1\nkind: MachineConfig\nmetadata:\n  creationTimestamp: null\n  labels:\n    machineconfiguration.openshift.io/role: worker\n  name: 99-worker-etc-chrony-conf\nspec:\n  config:\n    ignition:\n      config: {}\n      security:\n        tls: {}\n      timeouts: {}\n      version: 3.1.0\n    networkd: {}\n    passwd: {}\n    storage:\n      files:\n      - contents:\n          source: data:text/plain;charset=utf-8;base64,$(cat chrony.conf | base64 -w 0)\n        group:\n          name: root\n        mode: 420\n        overwrite: true\n        path: /etc/chrony.conf\n        user:\n          name: root\n  osImageURL: \"\"\nEOF\n\nMake a backup copy of the configuration file.\n\nApply the configuration in one of two ways:\n\nIf the cluster is not up yet, generate manifest files, add this file to the openshift directory, and then continue to create the cluster. Example:\ngenerate the cluster manifests:\n./openshift-install create manifests --dir install-config/ --log-level debug\nAnd then copy the 2 files into install_dir/manifests:\ncp 99_masters-chrony-configuration.yaml install-config/manifests/.\ncp 99_workers-chrony-configuration.yaml install-config/manifests/.\nThen, deploy the cluster:\n./openshift-install create cluster --dir install-config/ --log-level debug\n\nIf the cluster is already running, apply the file as follows:\noc apply -f ./99_masters-chrony-configuration.yaml\noc apply -f ./99_workers-chrony-configuration.yaml\n\n\n\n\n"},"infrastructure-monitoring-alerts.html":{"url":"infrastructure-monitoring-alerts.html","title":"OpenShift Platform Monitoring and Alert","keywords":"","body":"Cluster Monitoring and Alerts\n\n\nCluster Monitoring and Alerts\nPrerequisites\nOpenShift Mornitering and Alert\nConfiguring the monitoring stack\nManaging alerts\nSending notifications to external systems\nTesing Alerts\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nOpenShift 4.6 on VMware 6.7 U3+ or 7.0\nVMware Cloud Native Storage to support CNS CSI\nOpenShift installer\nNode subnet with DHCP pool\nDNS\nNTP\n\n\n\nOpenShift Mornitering and Alert\nOpenShift Container Platform includes a pre-configured, pre-installed, and self-updating monitoring stack that provides monitoring for core platform components. OpenShift Container Platform delivers monitoring best practices out of the box. A set of alerts are included by default that immediately notify cluster administrators about issues with a cluster. Default dashboards in the OpenShift Container Platform web console include visual representations of cluster metrics to help you to quickly understand the state of your cluster.\nThe OpenShift Container Platform monitoring stack is based on the Prometheus open source project and its wider ecosystem. The monitoring stack includes the following:\n\nDefault platform monitoring components. A set of platform monitoring components are installed in the openshift-monitoring project by default during an OpenShift Container Platform installation. This provides monitoring for core OpenShift Container Platform components including Kubernetes services. The default monitoring stack also enables remote health monitoring for clusters. These components are illustrated in the Installed by default section in the following diagram.\n\nComponents for monitoring user-defined projects. After optionally enabling monitoring for user-defined projects, additional monitoring components are installed in the openshift-user-workload-monitoring project. This provides monitoring for user-defined projects.\n\n\nDefault monitoring targets\nIn addition to the components of the stack itself, the default monitoring stack monitors:\n\nCoreDNS\nElasticsearch (if Logging is installed)\netcd\nFluentd (if Logging is installed)\nHAProxy\nImage registry\nKubelets\nKubernetes apiserver\nKubernetes controller manager\nKubernetes scheduler\nMetering (if Metering is installed)\nOpenShift apiserver\nOpenShift controller manager\nOperator Lifecycle Manager (OLM)\n\nConfiguring the monitoring stack\nThe OpenShift Container Platform 4 installation program provides only a low number of configuration options before installation. Configuring most OpenShift Container Platform framework components, including the cluster monitoring stack, happens post-installation.\nYou can configure the monitoring stack by creating and updating monitoring config maps.\nProcedure\n\nCheck whether the cluster-monitoring-config ConfigMap object exists:\noc -n openshift-monitoring get configmap cluster-monitoring-config\n\n\nIf the ConfigMap object does not exist:\nCreate and apply the following YAML manifest. In this example the file is called cluster-monitoring-config.yaml:\ncat \n\n\nManaging alerts\nIn OpenShift Container Platform 4.6, the Alerting UI enables you to manage alerts, silences, and alerting rules.\n\nAlerting rules. Alerting rules contain a set of conditions that outline a particular state within a cluster. Alerts are triggered when those conditions are true. An alerting rule can be assigned a severity that defines how the alerts are routed.\n\nAlerts. An alert is fired when the conditions defined in an alerting rule are true. Alerts provide a notification that a set of circumstances are apparent within an OpenShift Container Platform cluster.\n\nSilences. A silence can be applied to an alert to prevent notifications from being sent when the conditions for an alert are true. You can mute an alert after the initial notification, while you work on resolving the underlying issue.\n\n\nUnderstanding alert filters\nIn the Administrator perspective, the Alerts page in the Alerting UI provides details about alerts relating to default OpenShift Container Platform and user-defined projects. The page includes a summary of severity, state, and source for each alert. The time at which an alert went into its current state is also shown.\nYou can filter by alert state, severity, and source. By default, only Platform alerts that are Firing are displayed. The following describes each alert filtering option:\n\nAlert State filters:\n\nFiring. The alert is firing because the alert condition is true and the optional for duration has passed. The alert will continue to fire as long as the condition remains true.\nPending. The alert is active but is waiting for the duration that is specified in the alerting rule before it fires.\nSilenced. The alert is now silenced for a defined time period. Silences temporarily mute alerts based on a set of label selectors that you define. Notifications will not be sent for alerts that match all the listed values or regular expressions.\n\n\nSeverity filters:\n\nCritical. The condition that triggered the alert could have a critical impact. The alert requires immediate attention when fired and is typically paged to an individual or to a critical response team.\nWarning. The alert provides a warning notification about something that might require attention in order to prevent a problem from occurring. Warnings are typically routed to a ticketing system for non-immediate review.\nInfo. The alert is provided for informational purposes only.\nNone. The alert has no defined severity.\nYou can also create custom severity definitions for alerts relating to user-defined projects.\n\n\nSource filters:\n\nPlatform. Platform-level alerts relate only to default OpenShift Container Platform projects. These projects provide core OpenShift Container Platform functionality.\nUser. User alerts relate to user-defined projects. These alerts are user-created and are customizable. User-defined workload monitoring can be enabled post-installation to provide observability into your own workloads.\n\n\n\nSending notifications to external systems\nIn OpenShift Container Platform 4.6, firing alerts can be viewed in the Alerting UI. Alerts are not configured by default to be sent to any notification systems. You can configure OpenShift Container Platform to send alerts to the following receiver types:\n\nPagerDuty\nWebhook\nEmail\nSlack\n\nRouting alerts to receivers enables you to send timely notifications to the appropriate teams when failures occur. For example, critical alerts require immediate attention and are typically paged to an individual or a critical response team. Alerts that provide non-critical warning notifications might instead be routed to a ticketing system for non-immediate review.\n**Set up Test Mail Server and Slack Channel\nBefore we configure the AlertManager to send email and slack alert, we will need to run a webmail with smtp and slack channel for testing\n\nDeploy the maildev in default namespace and expose webmail\noc project default\noc new-app --docker-image=maildev/maildev --name='maildev'\noc expose service/maildev --port=80\n\nFrom this deployment you can reach smtp via maildev.default.svc.cluster.local:25 and webmail from route host using command oc get route\n\nCreate Slack Channel webhooks token, or use prepared token you have\n\nWebhook notification with line-notify-gateway\nYou will need to setup Line Notification service to allow Line Notifications in your chat group. After you setup you will get your token to use in AlertManager webhook to line-notify-gateway container, which is provided as an example for receive AlertManager webhook json and send to Line Notification Service.\noc -n default new-app --docker-image=nontster/line-notify-gateway\noc -n default get svc\n\n\n\nConfiguring alert receivers\nProcedure\n\nIn the Administrator perspective, navigate to Administration â†’ Cluster Settings â†’ Global Configuration â†’ Alertmanager.\n\nYou can apply Alert Receivers configuration example that includes receivers for smtp to webmail, slack and line-notification-gateway.\n cat -\n     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\n type: Opaque\n EOF\n\n Configuration content in plain-text\n global:\n   resolve_timeout: 5m\n   smtp_from: ocp@example.com\n   smtp_smarthost: 'maildev.default.svc.cluster.local:25'\n   smtp_hello: localhost\n   smtp_require_tls: false\n   slack_api_url: >-\n     https://hooks.slack.com/services/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\n inhibit_rules:\n   -

OpenShift ships with an elastic log aggregation solution: EFK. (ElasticSearch, Fluentd and Kibana)\nThe cluster logging components are based upon Elasticsearch, Fluentd, and Kibana (EFK). The collector, Fluentd, is deployed to each node in the OpenShift cluster. It collects all node and container logs and writes them to Elasticsearch (ES). Kibana is the centralized, web UI where users and administrators can create rich visualizations and dashboards with the aggregated data. Administrators can see and search through all logs. Application owners and developers can allow access to logs that belong to their projects. The EFK stack runs on top of OpenShift.\nWarning\nThis lab requires that you have completed the infra-nodes lab. The logging stack will be installed on the infra nodes that were created in that lab.\nDeploying OpenShift Logging\nOpenShift Container Platform cluster logging is designed to be used with the default configuration, which is tuned for small to medium sized OpenShift Container Platform clusters. The installation instructions that follow include a sample Cluster Logging Custom Resource (CR), which you can use to create a cluster logging instance and configure your cluster logging deployment.\nIf you want to use the default cluster logging install, you can use the sample CR directly.\nIf you want to customize your deployment, make changes to the sample CR as needed. The following describes the configurations you can make when installing your cluster logging instance or modify after installtion. See the Configuring sections for more information on working with each component, including modifications you can make outside of the Cluster Logging Custom Resource.\nCreate the openshift-logging namespace\nOpenShift Logging will be run from within its own namespace openshift-logging. This namespace does not exist by default, and needs to be created before logging may be installed. The namespace is represented in yaml format as:\napiVersion: v1\nkind: Namespace\nmetadata:\n  name: openshift-logging\n  annotations:\n    openshift.io/node-selector: \"\"\n  labels:\n    openshift.io/cluster-logging: \"true\"\n    openshift.io/cluster-monitoring: \"true\"\n\nTo create the namespace, run the following command:\ncat \nInstall the Elasticsearch and Cluster Logging Operators in the cluster\nIn order to install and configure the EFK stack into the cluster, additional operators need to be installed. These can be installed from the Operator Hub from within the cluster via the GUI.\nWhen using operators in OpenShift, it is important to understand the basics of some of the underlying principles that make up the Operators. CustomResourceDefinion (CRD) and CustomResource (CR) are two Kubernetes objects that we will briefly describe.CRDs are generic pre-defined structures of data. The operator understands how to apply the data that is defined by the CRD. In terms of programming, CRDs can be thought as being similar to a class. CustomResource (CR) is an actual implementations of the CRD, where the structured data has actual values. These values are what the operator will use when configuring itâ€™s service. Again, in programming terms, CRs would be similar to an instantiated object of the class.\nThe general pattern for using Operators is first, install the Operator, which will create the necessary CRDs. After the CRDs have been created, we can create the CR which will tell the operator how to act, what to install, and/or what to configure. For installing openshift-logging, we will follow this pattern.\nTo begin, log-in to the OpenShift Clusterâ€™s GUI.\nThen follow the following steps:\n\nInstall the Elasticsearch Operator:\n\nIn the OpenShift console, click Operators â†’ OperatorHub.\nChoose Elasticsearch Operator from the list of available Operators, and click Install.\nOn the Create Operator Subscription page, select Update Channel 4.6, leave all other defaults and then click Subscribe.\nThis makes the Operator available to all users and projects that use this OpenShift Container Platform cluster.\n\n\nInstall the Cluster Logging Operator:\nNote\nThe Cluster Logging operator needs to be installed in the openshift-logging namespace. Please ensure that the openshift-logging namespace was created from the previous steps\n\nIn the OpenShift console, click Operators â†’ OperatorHub.\nChoose Cluster Logging from the list of available Operators, and click Install.\nOn the Create Operator Subscription page, Under ensure Installation Mode that A specific namespace on the cluster is selected, and choose openshift-logging. In addition, select Update Channel 4.6 and leave all other defaults and then click Subscribe.\n\n\nVerify the operator installations:\n\nSwitch to the Operators â†’ Installed Operators page.\nMake sure the openshift-logging project is selected.\nIn the Status column you should see green checks with either InstallSucceeded or Copied and the text Up to date.\nNote\nDuring installation an operator might display a Failed status. If the operator then installs with an InstallSucceeded message, you can safely ignore the Failed message.\n\n\n\nCreate the Loggging CustomResource (CR) instance\nNow that we have the operators installed, along with the CRDs, we can now kick off the logging install by creating a Logging CR. This will define how we want to install and configure logging.\n\nIn the OpenShift Console, switch to the the Administration â†’ Custom Resource Definitions page.\nOn the Custom Resource Definitions page, click ClusterLogging.\nOn the Custom Resource Definition Overview page, select View Instances from the Actions menu\n Note\n If you see a 404 error, donâ€™t panic. While the operator installation succeeded, the operator itself has not finished installing and the CustomResourceDefinition may not have been created yet. Wait a few moments and then refresh the page.\nOn the Cluster Loggings page, click Create Cluster Logging.\nIn the YAML editor, replace the code with the following:\n Note: you need to change storageclass that available in your environment apiVersion: \"logging.openshift.io/v1\"\n kind: \"ClusterLogging\"\n metadata:\n   name: \"instance\"\n   namespace: \"openshift-logging\"\n spec:\n   managementState: \"Managed\"\n   logStore:\n     type: \"elasticsearch\"\n     elasticsearch:\n       nodeCount: 3\n       storage:\n         storageClassName: thin\n         size: 100Gi\n       redundancyPolicy: \"SingleRedundancy\"\n       nodeSelector:\n         node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: \"\"\n       resources:\n         request:\n           memory: 4G\n   visualization:\n     type: \"kibana\"\n     kibana:\n       replicas: 1\n       nodeSelector:\n         node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: \"\"\n   curation:\n     type: \"curator\"\n     curator:\n       schedule: \"30 3 * * *\"\n       nodeSelector:\n         node-role.kubernetes.io/infra: \"\"\n   collection:\n     logs:\n       type: \"fluentd\"\n       fluentd: {}\n\n\nThen click Create.\n\nVerify the Loggging install\nNow that Logging has been created, letâ€™s verify that things are working.\n\nSwitch to the Workloads â†’ Pods page.\nSelect the openshift-logging project.\n\nYou should see pods for cluster logging (the operator itself), Elasticsearch, and Fluentd, and Kibana.\nAlternatively, you can verify from the command line by using the following command:\noc get pods -n openshift-logging\n\nYou should eventually see something like:\nNAME                                            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\ncluster-logging-operator-cb795f8dc-xkckc        1/1     Running   0          32m\nelasticsearch-cdm-b3nqzchd-1-5c6797-67kfz       2/2     Running   0          14m\nelasticsearch-cdm-b3nqzchd-2-6657f4-wtprv       2/2     Running   0          14m\nelasticsearch-cdm-b3nqzchd-3-588c65-clg7g       2/2     Running   0          14m\nfluentd-2c7dg                                   1/1     Running   0          14m\nfluentd-9z7kk                                   1/1     Running   0          14m\nfluentd-br7r2                                   1/1     Running   0          14m\nfluentd-fn2sb                                   1/1     Running   0          14m\nfluentd-pb2f8                                   1/1     Running   0          14m\nfluentd-zqgqx                                   1/1     Running   0          14m\nkibana-7fb4fd4cc9-bvt4p                         2/2     Running   0          14m\n\nThe Fluentd Pods are deployed as part of a DaemonSet, which is a mechanism to ensure that specific Pods run on specific Nodes in the cluster at all times:\noc get daemonset -n openshift-logging\n\nYou will see something like:\nNAME      DESIRED   CURRENT   READY   UP-TO-DATE   AVAILABLE   NODE SELECTOR            AGE\nfluentd   9         9         9       9            9           kubernetes.io/os=linux   94s\n\nYou should expect 1 fluentd Pod for every Node in your cluster. Remember that Masters are still Nodes and fluentd will run there, too, to slurp the various logs.\nYou will also see the storage for ElasticSearch has been automatically provisioned. If you query the PersistentVolumeClaim objects in this project you will see the new storage.\noc get pvc -n openshift-logging\n\nYou will see something like:\nNAME                                         STATUS   VOLUME                                     CAPACITY   ACCESS\nMODES   STORAGECLASS                  AGE\nelasticsearch-elasticsearch-cdm-ggzilasv-1   Bound    pvc-f3239564-389c-11ea-bab2-06ca7918708a   100Gi      RWO\n        ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd   15m\nelasticsearch-elasticsearch-cdm-ggzilasv-2   Bound    pvc-f324a252-389c-11ea-bab2-06ca7918708a   100Gi      RWO\n        ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd   15m\nelasticsearch-elasticsearch-cdm-ggzilasv-3   Bound    pvc-f326aa7d-389c-11ea-bab2-06ca7918708a   100Gi      RWO\n        ocs-storagecluster-ceph-rbd   15m\n\nNote\nMuch like with the Metrics solution, we defined the appropriate NodeSelector in the Logging configuration (CR) to ensure that the Logging components only landed on the infra nodes. That being said, the DaemonSet ensures FluentD runs on all nodes. Otherwise we would not capture all of the container logs.\nAccessing Kibana\nAs mentioned before, Kibana is the front end and the way that users and admins may access the OpenShift Logging stack. To reach the Kibana user interface, first determine its public access URL by querying the Route that got set up to expose Kibanaâ€™s Service:\nTo find and access the Kibana route:\n\nIn the OpenShift console, click on the Networking â†’ Routes page.\nSelect the openshift-logging project.\nClick on the Kibana route.\nIn the Location field, click on the URL presented.\nClick through and accept the SSL certificates\n\nAlternatively, this can be obtained from the command line:\noc get route -n openshift-logging\n\nYou will see something like:\nNAME     HOST/PORT                                                           PATH   SERVICES   PORT    TERMINATION          WILDCARD\nkibana   kibana-openshift-logging.{{ ROUTE_SUBDOMAIN }}          kibana        reencrypt/Redirect   None\n\nThere is a special authentication proxy that is configured as part of the EFK installation that results in Kibana requiring OpenShift credentials for access.\nBecause youâ€™ve already authenticated to the OpenShift Console as a cluster-admin user, you will see an administrative view of what Kibana has to show you (which you authorized by clicking the button).\nQueries with Kibana\nOnce the Kibana web interface is up, we are now able to do queries. Kibana offers a the user a powerful interface to query all logs that come from the cluster.\nBy default, Kibana will show all logs that have been received within the the last 15 minutes. This time interval may be changed in the upper right hand corner. The log messages are shown in the middle of the page. All log messages that are received are indexed based on the log message content. Each message will have fields associated that are associated to that log message. To see the fields that make up an individual message, click on the arrow on the side of each message located in the center of the page. This will show the message fields that are contained.\nFirst, set the default index pattern to .all. On the left hand side towards the top, in the drop down menu select the .all index pattern.\nTo select fields to show for messages, look on left hand side fore the Available Fields label. Below this are fields that can be selected and shown in the middle of the screen. Find the hostname field below the Available Fields and click add. Notice now, in the message pain, each messageâ€™s hostname is displayed. More fields may be added. Click the add button for kubernetes.pod_name and also for message.\nTo create a query for logs, the Add a filter + link right below the search box may be used. This will allow us to build queries using the fields of the messages. For example, if we wanted to see all log messages from the openshift-logging namespace, we can do the following:\n\nClick on Add a filter +.\nIn the Fields input box, start typing kubernetes.namespace_name. Notice all of the available fields that we can use to build the query\nNext, select is.\nIn the Value field, type in openshift-logging\nClick the \"Save\" button\n\nNow, in the center of the screen you will see all of the logs from all the pods in the openshift-logging namespace.\nOf course, you may add more filters to refine the query.\nOne other neat option that Kibana allows you to do is save queries to use for later. To save a query do the following:\n\nclick on Save at the top of the screen.\nType in the name you would like to save it as. In this case, letâ€™s type in openshift-logging Namespace\n\nOnce this has been saved, it can be used at a later time by hitting the Open button and selecting this query.\nPlease take time to explore the Kibana page and get experience by adding and doing more queries. This will be helpful when using a production cluster, you will be able to get the exact logs that you are looking for in a single place.\n"},"infrastructure-networking.html":{"url":"infrastructure-networking.html","title":"OpenShift Networking","keywords":"","body":"Infrastructure Networking\n\n\nInfrastructure Networking\nPrerequisites\nOpenShift Network Policy Based SDN\nSwitch Your Project\nExecute the Creation Script\nExamine the created infrastructure\nTest Connectivity should work\nRestricting Access\nTest Connectivity #2 should fail\nAllow Access\nTest Connectivity #3 should work again\nTest Connectivity #4 while chaning NetworkPolicy\n\n\nEgress IP address assignment for project egress traffic\nConfiguring automatically assigned egress IP addresses for a namespace\n\n\nNetwork Logging\nContainer Platform Network Segmentation\nMulti-Cluster Level\nCluster Namespace separation level\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nOpenShift 4.6 on VMware 6.7 U3+ or 7.0\n\nOpenShift Network Policy Based SDN\nOpenShift has a software defined network (SDN) inside the platform that is based\non Open vSwitch. This SDN is used to provide connectivity between application\ncomponents inside of the OpenShift environment. It comes with default network\nranges pre-configured, although you can make changes to these should they\nconflict with your existing infrastructure, or for whatever other reason you may\nhave.\nThe OpenShift Network Policy SDN plug-in allows projects to truly isolate their\nnetwork infrastructure inside OpenShiftâ€™s software defined network. While you\nhave seen projects isolate resources through OpenShiftâ€™s RBAC, the network policy\nSDN plugin is able to isolate pods in projects using pod and namespace label selectors.\nThe network policy SDN plugin was introduced in OpenShift 3.7, and more\ninformation about it and its configuration can be found in the\nlink:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/3.11/architecture/networking/sdn.html[networking\ndocumentation^]. Additionally, other vendors are working with the upstream\nKubernetes community to implement their own SDN plugins, and several of these\nare supported by the vendors for use with OpenShift. These plugin\nimplementations make use of appc/CNI, which is outside the scope of this lab.\nSwitch Your Project\nBefore continuing, make sure you are using a project that actually exists.

Execute the\nfollowing command to see the created resources:\noc get pods -n netproj-a\n\nAfter a while you will see something like the following:\nNAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\niperf3-clients-7c566cfdc-7dtn5   1/1     Running   0          14m\n\nSimilarly:\noc get pods -n netproj-b\n\nAfter a while you will see something like the following:\nNAME                                      READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE\niperf3-server-deployment-79c44f8b-6bkrn   1/1     Running   0          14m\n\nWe will run commands inside the pod in the netproj-a Project that will\nconnect to TCP port 5201 of the pod in the netproj-b Project.\nTest Connectivity (should work)\nNow that you have some projects and pods, let's test the connectivity between\nthe pod in the netproj-a Project and the pod in the netproj-b Project.\nTo test connectivity between the two pods, run:\nexport client=$(oc get pod -n netproj-a | grep iperf3-clients | cut -d' ' -f1)\n\noc exec $client -n netproj-a -- /bin/sh -c 'iperf3 -c iperf3-server.netproj-b.svc.cluster.local -t 10 -b 1G'\n\nYou will see something like the following:\nConnecting to host iperf3-server.netproj-b.svc.cluster.local, port 5201\n[  5] local 10.131.0.55 port 58320 connected to 172.30.101.62 port 5201\n[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bitrate         Retr  Cwnd\n[  5]   0.00-1.00   sec   119 MBytes   997 Mbits/sec    0    491 KBytes\n[  5]   1.00-2.00   sec   119 MBytes  1.00 Gbits/sec    1    691 KBytes\n[  5]   2.00-3.00   sec   119 MBytes  1.00 Gbits/sec    1   1.21 MBytes\n[  5]   3.00-4.00   sec   119 MBytes  1.00 Gbits/sec    1   1.21 MBytes\n[  5]   4.00-5.00   sec   119 MBytes   999 Mbits/sec    1   1.55 MBytes\n[  5]   5.00-6.00   sec   119 MBytes  1.00 Gbits/sec    0   1.71 MBytes\n[  5]   6.00-7.00   sec   119 MBytes  1.00 Gbits/sec    0   1.71 MBytes\n[  5]   7.00-8.00   sec   119 MBytes   997 Mbits/sec    0   1.71 MBytes\n[  5]   8.00-9.00   sec   119 MBytes  1.00 Gbits/sec    1   1.71 MBytes\n[  5]   9.00-10.00  sec   119 MBytes  1.00 Gbits/sec    1   1.79 MBytes\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bitrate         Retr\n[  5]   0.00-10.00  sec  1.16 GBytes  1000 Mbits/sec    6             sender\n[  5]   0.00-10.00  sec  1.16 GBytes  1000 Mbits/sec                  receiver\n\niperf Done.\n\nNote that the last line says worked. This means that the pod in the\nnetproj-a Project was able to connect to the pod in the netproj-b\nProject.\nThis worked because, by default, with the network policy SDN, all pods in all\nprojects can connect to each other.\nRestricting Access\nWith the Network Policy based SDN, it's possible to restrict access in a\nproject by creating a NetworkPolicy custom resource (CR).\nFor example, the following restricts all access to all pods in a Project\nwhere this NetworkPolicy CR is applied. This is the equivalent of a DenyAll\ndefault rule on a firewall:\nkind: NetworkPolicy\napiVersion: networking.k8s.io/v1\nmetadata:\n  name: deny-by-default\nspec:\n  podSelector: null\n  ingress:\n    - from:\n        - podSelector: {}\n\nNote that the podSelector is empty, which means that this will apply to all\npods in this Project. Also note that the ingress list is empty, which\nmeans that there are no allowed ingress rules defined by this\nNetworkPolicy CR.\nTo restrict access to the pod in the netproj-b Project simply apply the\nabove NetworkPolicy CR with:\ncat \nTest Connectivity #2 (should fail)\nSince the \"block all by default\" NetworkPolicy CR has been applied,\nconnectivity between the pod in the netproj-a Project and the pod in the\nnetproj-b Project should now be blocked.\nTest by running:\noc exec $client -n netproj-a -- /bin/sh -c 'iperf3 -c iperf3-server.netproj-b.svc.cluster.local -t 10 -b 1G'\n\nYou will see something like the following:\niperf3: error - unable to connect to server: Connection timed out\ncommand terminated with exit code 1\n\nNote the last line that says FAILED!. This means that the pod in the\nnetproj-a Project was unable to connect to the pod in the netproj-b\nProject (as expected).\nAllow Access\nWith the Network Policy based SDN, it's possible to allow access to\nindividual or groups of pods in a project by creating multiple\nNetworkPolicy CRs.\nThe following allows access to port 5000 on TCP for all pods in the project\nwith the label app: iperf3-server. The pod in the netproj-b project has this label.\nThe ingress section specifically allows this access from all projects that\nhave the label app: iperf3-client.\n# allow access to TCP port 5201 for pods with the label \"run: ose\" specifically\n# from projects with the label \"name: netproj-a\".\ncat \nNote that the podSelector is where the local project's pods are matched\nusing a specific label selector.\nAll NetworkPolicy CRs in a project are combined to create the allowed\ningress access for the pods in the project. In this specific case the \"deny\nall\" policy is combined with the \"allow TCP 5201\" policy.\nTest Connectivity #3 (should work again)\nSince the \"allow access from netproj-a on port 5000\" NetworkPolicy has been applied,\nconnectivity between the pod in the netproj-a Project and the pod in the\nnetproj-b Project should be allowed again.\nTest by running:\noc exec $client -n netproj-a -- /bin/sh -c 'iperf3 -c iperf3-server.netproj-b.svc.cluster.local -t 10 -b 1G'\n\nYou will see something like the following:\nConnecting to host iperf3-server.netproj-b.svc.cluster.local, port 5201\n[  5] local 10.131.0.55 port 34702 connected to 172.30.101.62 port 5201\n[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bitrate         Retr  Cwnd\n[  5]   0.00-1.00   sec   119 MBytes   999 Mbits/sec    2    274 KBytes\n[  5]   1.00-2.00   sec   119 MBytes  1.00 Gbits/sec    0    300 KBytes\n[  5]   2.00-3.00   sec   119 MBytes  1.00 Gbits/sec    0    362 KBytes\n[  5]   3.00-4.00   sec   119 MBytes  1.00 Gbits/sec    0    385 KBytes\n[  5]   4.00-5.00   sec   119 MBytes   999 Mbits/sec    0    397 KBytes\n[  5]   5.00-6.00   sec   119 MBytes  1.00 Gbits/sec    0    403 KBytes\n[  5]   6.00-7.00   sec   119 MBytes   999 Mbits/sec    1    412 KBytes\n[  5]   7.00-8.00   sec   119 MBytes  1.00 Gbits/sec    0    448 KBytes\n[  5]   8.00-9.00   sec   119 MBytes  1.00 Gbits/sec    1    459 KBytes\n[  5]   9.00-10.00  sec   119 MBytes   999 Mbits/sec    0    463 KBytes\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n[ ID] Interval           Transfer     Bitrate         Retr\n[  5]   0.00-10.00  sec  1.16 GBytes  1000 Mbits/sec    4             sender\n[  5]   0.00-10.03  sec  1.16 GBytes   997 Mbits/sec                  receiver\n\niperf Done.\n\nNote the last line that says worked.

External resources can recognize traffic from a particular project based on the egress IP address. An egress IP address assigned to a project is different from the egress router, which is used to send traffic to specific destinations.\nEgress IP addresses are implemented as additional IP addresses on the primary network interface of the node and must be in the same subnet as the nodeâ€™s primary IP address.\nHigh availability of nodes is automatic. If a node that hosts an egress IP address is unreachable and there are nodes that are able to host that egress IP address, then the egress IP address will move to a new node. When the unreachable node comes back online, the egress IP address automatically moves to balance egress IP addresses across nodes.\nConfiguring automatically assigned egress IP addresses for a namespace\nIn OpenShift Container Platform you can enable automatic assignment of an egress IP address for a specific namespace across one or more nodes.\n\nTest ping from pod in netproj-a to VM outside OpenShift, the source IP Address is the Node IP Address [root@centos7-tools1 ~]# tcpdump -i ens160 icmp\n tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode\n listening on ens160, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes\n 08:37:18.756559 IP 198.18.1.18 > tools1.dcloud.cisco.com: ICMP echo request, id 3, seq 1, length 64\n 08:37:18.756627 IP tools1.dcloud.cisco.com > 198.18.1.18: ICMP echo reply, id 3, seq 1, length 64\n 08:37:19.757960 IP 198.18.1.18 > tools1.dcloud.cisco.com: ICMP echo request, id 3, seq 2, length 64\n 08:37:19.758014 IP tools1.dcloud.cisco.com > 198.18.1.18: ICMP echo reply, id 3, seq 2, length 64\n\n\nUpdate the NetNamespace object with the egress IP address using the following JSON: oc patch netnamespace netproj-a --type=merge -p \\\n '{\"egressIPs\": [\"198.18.1.241\"]}'\n\n You can set egressIPs to two or more IP addresses on different nodes to provide high availability. If multiple egress IP addresses are set, pods use the first IP in the list for egress, but if the node hosting that IP address fails, pods switch to using the next IP in the list after a short delay.\nManually assign the egress IP to the node hosts. Set the egressIPs parameter on the HostSubnet object on the node host. Using the following JSON, include as many IPs as you want to assign to that node host:\n for node in $(oc get nodes | grep '\\-worker' | cut -d' ' -f1); do\n oc patch hostsubnet $node --type=merge -p '{\"egressCIDRs\": [\"198.18.1.0/24\"]}'\n done\n\n In the previous example, all egress traffic for project1 will be routed to the node hosting the specified egress IP, and then connected (using NAT) to that IP address.\n\nTest ping from the same POD in netproj-a again, now the source IP Address is now egressIP assigned to netproj-a [root@centos7-tools1 ~]# tcpdump -i ens160 icmp\n tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v or -vv for full protocol decode\n listening on ens160, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), capture size 262144 bytes\n 09:08:33.841050 IP 198.18.1.241 > registry0.example.com: ICMP echo request, id 7, seq 130, length 64\n 09:08:33.841131 IP registry0.example.com > 198.18.1.241: ICMP echo reply, id 7, seq 130, length 64\n 09:08:34.861757 IP 198.18.1.241 > registry0.example.com: ICMP echo request, id 7, seq 131, length 64\n 09:08:34.861815 IP registry0.example.com > 198.18.1.241: ICMP echo reply, id 7, seq 131, length 64\n\n\n\nNetwork Logging\nThe network access logging will be done with envoy sidecar proxy, the details will be in OpenShift Service Mesh section.\nContainer Platform Network Segmentation\nFor the network segregation requirement on Container Platform, we can consider multiple choices of strategy for the network segregation levels supported in OpenShift design architectures. The following are the options that we could do to helps network segmentations are enforced at each level\nMulti-Cluster Level\nThe highest level of separation is to dedicate one cluster per environment per network zone, e.g. 1 Cluster for Private Zone(Internal Only), 1 Cluster for Extranet Zone and 1 Cluster for DMZ Zone (Internet facing). By seprating clusters per network zone, you can ensure that everything is separated from each environemnt. The deployment can be done in a Pipeline to deploy to each cluster in each stage.\nPros:\n\nHighest level of separation. Resources, RBAC, NetworkPolicy, Storage, etc. are per cluster. You can also dedicate a cluster per enduser team as well\nLeast scope of security breach will be limited within a cluster\n\nCons:\n\nConsume more resources for Control Plane, Storage, Networking, Monitoring, Logging, etc. per cluster\nHigh maintenance and operations for Multi-Cluster Management, if you don't prepare Multi-Cluster Management tools. Example ArgoCD, Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management\n\nCluster Namespace separation level\nIn the Container Platform, many technology and components are supporting separation of resources within a cluster. The components that can be used for separation are\n\nContainer Runtime, CGroups, SELinux:\nContainer Host level for Application resource segration on container host\nProject/Namespace:\nWe can do the resource seprating by RBAC, Resource Quotas\nNode Seletor:\nTo select node for sepecific resources\nRouter/Ingress Sharding:\nWe can dedicate Router/Ingress Controller to be the ingestion point in each network zone\n\nPros:\n\nResource efficientcy: by using the same cluster to shared control plane and infrastructure components\nLess management: less number of clusters to manage and upgrade\nFocused on Environment: by reducing overall resources, you can focused to have an identical, but smaller, OpenShift Cluster for Testing and Development environment. This can help you to have a test bed for testing integration, operation, BCP or upgrade.\n\nCons:\n\nMore Router/Ingress Infra nodes\nEnd user can't get full cluster-admin control when compare with dedicated cluster per team approach, but OpenShift can somehow compensate by having Operators with multi tenants support, such as OpenShift Service Mesh, the user can create their own service mesh control plane\n\n"},"infrastructure-backup-etcd.html":{"url":"infrastructure-backup-etcd.html","title":"OpenShift state backup with etcd snapshot","keywords":"","body":"Infrastructure Basic\n\n\nInfrastructure Basic\nPrerequisites\nBackup etcd\nBacking up etcd data\n\n\nBackup etcd with cron job\nRestoring to a previous cluster state\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPrerequisites\n\nOpenShift 4.6 on VMware 6.7 U3+ or 7.0\nVMware Cloud Native Storage to support CNS CSI\nOpenShift installer\nNode subnet with DHCP pool\nDNS\nNTP\n\n\n\nBackup etcd\netcd is the key-value store for OpenShift Container Platform, which persists the state of all resource objects.\nBack up your clusterâ€™s etcd data regularly and store in a secure location ideally outside the OpenShift Container Platform environment.\nAfter you have an etcd backup, you can restore to a previous cluster state.\nBacking up etcd data\nFollow these steps to back up etcd data by creating an etcd snapshot and backing up the resources for the static pods. This backup can be saved and used at a later time if you need to restore etcd.\nPrerequisites\n\nYou have access to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.\nYou have checked whether the cluster-wide proxy is enabled.\n\nProcedure\n\nStart a debug session for a master node:\noc debug node/\n\n\nChange your root directory to the host:\nchroot /host\n\n\nIf the cluster-wide proxy is enabled, be sure that you have exported the NO_PROXY, HTTP_PROXY, and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables.\n\nRun the cluster-backup.sh script and pass in the location to save the backup to.\n/usr/local/bin/cluster-backup.sh /home/core/assets/backup\n\nExample script output\n1bf371f1b5a483927cd01bb593b0e12cff406eb8d7d0acf4ab079c36a0abd3f7\netcdctl version: 3.3.18\nAPI version: 3.3\nfound latest kube-apiserver-pod: /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/kube-apiserver-pod-7\nfound latest kube-controller-manager-pod: /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/kube-controller-manager-pod-8\nfound latest kube-scheduler-pod: /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/kube-scheduler-pod-6\nfound latest etcd-pod: /etc/kubernetes/static-pod-resources/etcd-pod-2\nSnapshot saved at /home/core/assets/backup/snapshot_2020-03-18_220218.db\nsnapshot db and kube resources are successfully saved to /home/core/assets/backup\n\nIn this example, two files are created in the /home/core/assets/backup/ directory on the master host:\n\nsnapshot_.db: This file is the etcd snapshot.\nstatickuberesources.tar.gz: This file contains the resources for the static pods.

You will use this snapshot to restore the cluster state.\nYou can use a saved etcd backup to restore back to a previous cluster state. You use the etcd backup to restore a single control plane host. Then the etcd cluster Operator handles scaling to the remaining master hosts.\nPrerequisites\n\nAccess to the cluster as a user with the cluster-admin role.\nSSH access to master hosts.\n\nA backup directory containing both the etcd snapshot and the resources for the static pods, which were from the same backup. The file names in the directory must be in the following formats: snapshot.db and static_kuberesources.tar.gz.\nProcedure\n\nSelect a control plane host to use as the recovery host. This is the host that you will run the restore operation on.\nEstablish SSH connectivity to each of the control plane nodes, including the recovery host.\nThe Kubernetes API server becomes inaccessible after the restore process starts, so you cannot access the control plane nodes. For this reason, it is recommended to establish SSH connectivity to each control plane host in a separate terminal.\nWarning: If you do not complete this step, you will not be able to access the master hosts to complete the restore procedure, and you will be unable to recover your cluster from this state.\nCopy the etcd backup directory to the recovery control plane host.\nThis procedure assumes that you copied the backup directory containing the etcd snapshot and the resources for the static pods to the /home/core/ directory of your recovery control plane host.\nStop the static pods on all other control plane nodes.\nNote: It is not required to manually stop the pods on the recovery host. The recovery script will stop the pods on the recovery host.\n\nAccess a control plane host that is not the recovery host.\nMove the existing etcd pod file out of the kubelet manifest directory:sudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/etcd-pod.yaml /tmp\n\n\nVerify that the etcd pods are stopped.\nsudo crictl ps | grep etcd\n\nThe output of this command should be empty. If it is not empty, wait a few minutes and check again.\n\nMove the existing Kubernetes API server pod file out of the kubelet manifest directory:\nsudo mv /etc/kubernetes/manifests/kube-apiserver-pod.yaml /tmp\n\n\nVerify that the Kubernetes API server pods are stopped.sudo crictl ps | grep kube-apiserver\n\nThe output of this command should be empty. If it is not empty, wait a few minutes and check again.\nMove the etcd data directory to a different location:sudo mv /var/lib/etcd/ /tmp\n\n\nRepeat this step on each of the other master hosts that is not the recovery host.\n\n\nAccess the recovery control plane host.\nIf the cluster-wide proxy is enabled, be sure that you have exported the NO_PROXY, HTTP_PROXY, and HTTPS_PROXY environment variables.\nYou can check whether the proxy is enabled by reviewing the output of oc get proxy cluster -o yaml. The proxy is enabled if the httpProxy, httpsProxy, and noProxy fields have values set.\nRun the restore script on the recovery control plane host and pass in the path to the etcd backup directory:\nsudo -E /usr/local/bin/cluster-restore.sh /home/core/backup\n\nExample script output\n...stopping kube-scheduler-pod.yaml\n...stopping kube-controller-manager-pod.yaml\n...stopping etcd-pod.yaml\n...stopping kube-apiserver-pod.yaml\nWaiting for container etcd to stop\n.complete\nWaiting for container etcdctl to stop\n.............................complete\nWaiting for container etcd-metrics to stop\ncomplete\nWaiting for container kube-controller-manager to stop\ncomplete\nWaiting for container kube-apiserver to stop\n..........................................................................................complete\nWaiting for container kube-scheduler to stop\ncomplete\nMoving etcd data-dir /var/lib/etcd/member to /var/lib/etcd-backup\nstarting restore-etcd static pod\nstarting kube-apiserver-pod.yaml\nstatic-pod-resources/kube-apiserver-pod-7/kube-apiserver-pod.yaml\nstarting kube-controller-manager-pod.yaml\nstatic-pod-resources/kube-controller-manager-pod-7/kube-controller-manager-pod.yaml\nstarting kube-scheduler-pod.yaml\nstatic-pod-resources/kube-scheduler-pod-8/kube-scheduler-pod.yaml\n\n\nRestart the kubelet service on all master hosts.\n\nFrom the recovery host, run the following command:sudo systemctl restart kubelet.service\n\n\nRepeat this step on all other master hosts.\n\n\nVerify that the single member control plane has started successfully.\n\nFrom the recovery host, verify that the etcd container is running.\nsudo crictl ps | grep etcd\n\nExample output\n3ad41b7908e32       36f86e2eeaaffe662df0d21041eb22b8198e0e58abeeae8c743c3e6e977e8009                                                         About a minute ago   Running             etcd                                          0                   7c05f8af362f0\n\n\nFrom the recovery host, verify that the etcd pod is running.\noc get pods -n openshift-etcd | grep etcd\n\nExample output\nNAME                                             READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE\netcd-ip-10-0-143-125.ec2.internal                1/1     Running     1          2m47s\n\nIf the status is Pending, or the output lists more than one running etcd pod, wait a few minutes and check again.\n\n\n\nForce etcd redeployment.\nIn a terminal that has access to the cluster as a cluster-admin user, run the following command:\noc patch etcd cluster -p='{\"spec\": {\"forceRedeploymentReason\": \"recovery-'\"$( date --rfc-3339=ns )\"'\"}}' --type=merge\n\nThe forceRedeploymentReason value must be unique, which is why a timestamp is appended.\nWhen the etcd cluster Operator performs a redeployment, the existing nodes are started with new pods similar to the initial bootstrap scale up.\n\nVerify all nodes are updated to the latest revision.\nIn a terminal that has access to the cluster as a cluster-admin user, run the following command:\noc get etcd -o=jsonpath='{range .items[0].status.conditions[?(@.type==\"NodeInstallerProgressing\")]}{.reason}{\"\\n\"}{.message}{\"\\n\"}'\n\nReview the NodeInstallerProgressing status condition for etcd to verify that all nodes are at the latest revision.
